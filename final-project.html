            <h1>Final Project</h1>
            <p>According to studies recorded by the National Institute of Health over 30% of frequent writers, including students and professionals, report experiencing wrist discomfort or strain due to excessive pressure during extended handwriting sessions. This issue has been documented over the past decade and affects a significant number of individuals in academic and professional environments all around the world.</p>
            <p>This problem is worded in this way to demonstrate the fact that wrist pain and discomfort are prevalent problems throghout our daily lives. This is emphaised through the American Journal of Industrial Medicine that states the fact that these repetitive motions and pressure on our wrists will cause pain, discomfort, and can lead to a series of issues such as arthritis. This problem is nothing small as orginizations such as the World Health Orginization emphasize the fact that these issues are not only common in our daily lives but can cause significant issues in the future that may lead us to damage our wrists in a manner that renders them useless or close to being so.</p>
