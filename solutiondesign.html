            <h1>Problem Definition</h1>
            <p>According to studies recorded by the National Institute of Health over 30% of frequent writers, including students and professionals, report experiencing wrist discomfort or strain due to excessive pressure during extended handwriting sessions. This issue has been documented over the past decade and affects a significant number of individuals in academic and professional environments all around the world.</p>
            <p>The main purpose of our project as stated previously is to help alleviate some wrist and joint pain in people who frequently write or type that encounter issues with wrist pain. While we donâ€™t seek to completely get rid of this pain as that would require much more intricate designs we seek to improve the experience of writing and give comfort to our users.</p>
            <p>Consumers: people who encounter situations of frequent writing in their profession which would cause them to have either pain or discomfort in their daily lives.</p>
            <p>End users: professionals who encounter writing in their daily lives or typing such as teachers, editors, copywriting, writers, journalists, or even students.</p>
            <p>Experts: this would be of interest to doctors or stores such as CVS/walgreens to help patients with this problem.</p>
            <h1>Concept Development</h1>
            <img src="images/Concept-1.png" alt="Concept-1" id="Concept-1">
            <p>This concept is a simple design that allows for a simple implementation of our research and ideas into a shape that should make for a hopefully simple creation. With the material we intend to use being nylon we want to bring a comfortable design that allows users to be able to quickly use this in their daily lives and offer a way to aid in reducing wrist pain in writing or typing. The size of this would rudimentary be long enough to support some of the lower arm for joints present in this area as well as a piece of the hand to further reinforce the wrist. This would be ~9 inches in length to cover this area as well as offering an adjustable experience. For example, as a student when I am writing an essay for a class I have issues with not only areas in my wrist but the lower parts of my arm as some joints connect to this area. This design not only offers coverage for the wrist but also the lower parts of the arm and we hope to have adjustable straps on this piece to allow for further comfort and flexibility. This is a strong solution as it offers a simple design and hopefully a resolution to the issue we are pursuing.</p>
            <img src="images/Concept-2.png" alt="Concept-2" id="Concept-2">
            <p>This is a glove that fits around the wrist and is attached to the fingers to apply a certain amount of pressure to the wrist to keep it stable depending on the fingers movements. While digging on current solutions to wrist pain a lot of gloves ended up appearing and what I thought was a better and more ergonomic solution. The glove would work by fitting around the wrist and palm but instead of having the standard glove fit onto the fingers were going to have a smaller ring shaped bands around each finger connected to the glove by a string which when pulled would then tighten the side to make sure the wrist is getting the right amount of pressure applied to not be hurt. The reason this is a strong solution is because gloves are an easy way to maintain constant pressure on the wrist while also being aesthetic.</p>

            <h1>Concept Analysis</h1>
            <p>This is the presentation we used in order to ask more qualified professionals for pointers on our ideas. What we gathered is that both ideas are pretty solid however they should probably both combine to one design and lose some aspects. These apects include my design covering the whole arm and the other design having strings as this would limit movement. We will take this advice to heart and this will help us workshop our design further.</p>
            <h1>Solution Selection</h1>
            <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-11-07 102710.png" alt="Decision Matrix" id="Decision-Matrix">
            <p>For the decision matrix we took into account the main parts that would make our designs sound being: cost, aesthetics, durability, performance, etc. We took into careful consideration each aspect of the desings but overall came to a concensus that my design was slightly better as it allowed for more flexibility and durability. However, my design can still be improved upon as it can be more efficient than designed at first.</p>
            <img src="images/Revised-Design.png" alt="Revised" id="Revised-Design>">
            <p>This is the revised design of our piece that we came up together that draws aspects from both pieces and also improves in functionality and efficieny from both designs. We use the same material here as in previous iterations and also took into account the advise from the professionals that we were able to speak with.</p>
            <h1>Detailed Design</h1>
            <img src="images/CAD sketch.png" alt="CAD" id="CAD-design">
            <p>One of the main components that we can improve upon for this is specifically the aesthetics as this concept design is similar to a cast which are not totally pleasing to look at. Our measurements are very flexible as we want it to fit our users despite their varying sizes of forearms and wrists. Our aim is to cover around half the forearm area and keep the hand covered to provide optimal assistance to our users. We will continue to workshop the design as we continue the project however this provides us with a very solid baseline for our first prototype. Do keep in mind that this is only a simple CAD sketch as of right now and our first prototype will be built soon.</p>
            <h1>Cost Estimation</h1>
            <p>~$25 dollars for materials such as nylon which are apart of the entire sleeve and will offer the most comftorable experience for our users and also allow the sleeve to be flexible.
                ~$30 bucks if we pay $15 an hour which could vary depending on how we want our sleeve to be made. This could take more or less time which may cost more if we request a more professional work to be done.
                Taking into account these prices, the first prototype should cost around $55-60 especially if we request to have a higher end prototype for our designs.</p>
            <h1>Daily Updates #1</h1>
            <h1>November 14, 2024</h1>
            <p>Today my group and I consulted certain experts on the field dealing with issues on the wrist and arm in general and asking for their input on our designs and if they could offer some criticism for us. One of these experts was a doctor that told us that our design was decently sound and offered us a pointer to some products that deal with similar problems that have seen some success within their patients. Some of these products are able to be found in popular medical stores such as CVS and are arms sleeves designed to offer support for the forearm and associated muscle/tendon groups. This is a good start for our design as we are provided a base to follow and from their we can branch out our design to also include the wrist.</p>
            <h1>November 16, 2024</h1>
            <img src="images/wrist brace.jpg" alt="wrist-brace" id="wrist-brace">
            <p>Today our group researched into the CVS wrist braces we were recommended and found one brace that fulfilled a good amount of our requirements. The problem we found with this brace is that it was not only somewhat heavy on the arm but it felt restrictive to our arms movement. With this design in mind we want to create a design that is comftorable for our users and provides adequate support like this brace did.</p>
            <h1>November 17, 2024</h1>
            <img src="images/dri-fit.jpg" alt="dri-fit" id="dri-fit">
            <p>Our group found an amazing prodcut today that fits almost all of the criteria we wanted to include in our arm and wirst sleeve which was the nike dri-fit technology. This line of products is comftorable for the user and even when the user sweats it keeps mostly dry which provides a very comfortable experience that we hope to bring to our users. In our research we found that the main materials used in this sleeve were polyster and spandex we will consider these materials for our prototype. One problem we found is that it is a little loose which means it provides minimal support which we at least want a moderate amount of support for the areas we want to cover.</p>
            <h1>November 20, 2024</h1>
            <img src="images/sleeve.jpg" alt="sleeve" id="sleeve">
            <img src="images/on hand.jpg" alt="hand" id="hand">
            <p>Our group decided that we would buy the arm sleeve from nike in order to test how it feels and the support it offers. This would offer us insight on how we wish to continue to construct our prototype and may give us a new baseline in terms of materials. When we wore it we noticed that it was a bit lacking in support as it was not really tight enough to offer said support. However, the big takeaways we got from this was the fact that the design is pleasing, it feels comftorable to wear, and it is easy to remove and put on. Our group wants to pursue this model and hopefully replicate the dri-fit technology as well as the various benefits mentioned beforehand for this prototype while also working on a way to fix the minimal support for the wrist that this product lacks.</p>
            <h1>November 21, 2024</h1>
            <p>Today we workshopped a solution for the lack of wrist support as we struggled to think of a way that would include the "glove" component of our design concept. While we were talking with each other and some people who were more educated on the subject of braces we came up with the idea to cut and sew a piece of the sleeve to mimic the hand allowing for a seamless glove that would hopefully solve our issue of a lack of wrist support. This would also solve a couple of issues that we previously had with the sleeve such as the length of the piece.</p>
