                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my website in which im working on a very ambitious project in order to help solve a big problem in a lot of people's daily lives which is frequent wrist pain. This is mainly for those who are in professional fields that require a lot of daily typing or writing that causes a significant amount of wrist discomfort or pain. With this project our group hopes to solve this daily inconvenience which affects most of us and our work. We are all currently seniors at Belen Jesuit Preparatory School and are looking forward to our graduation in 2025. Some of my hobbies include bodybuilding, running, and cycling which I do most days after school. My two favorite movie series include John Wick and Godzilla as they include amazing character development and have an amazing mix of action scenes. You can currently contact me at nquintana25@belenwolverines.org.</p>
