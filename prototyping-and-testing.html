            <p>This was our first day back from break but during break we were able to continue testing our first prototype by using it in our various activites during break. During this continued testing we were able to start developing how to fix the problems caused by the first design and got more opinions from others regarding our design. This mainly included problems with the looseness around the lower arm and a little less desirable wrist support than we wanted.</p>
            <h1>January 8 2025</h1>

            <p>Here I began to focus on one of the mini projects we were assigned where we had to make a 3D model of something that could not be made through deductive methods. I at first began to work on a sort of cone fidget thing (image above) but noticed that not only is the process to make this a little harder than anticipated, it was also something I would not really enjoy making.</p>
            <h1>January 10 2025</h1>
            <img src="images/mini-product.jpg" id="mini-product">
            <p>Today I worked and finished my 3D design of the first part of the mini project where you can read more about my process in the 3D scanning and printing section. Above you can see the final project of the 3D model and it makes for a very fun fidget toy.</p>
            <h1>January 14 2025</h1>
            <p>Today I learned and did the second part of the mini project which was the 3D scanning part. Again you can read more about this in the 3D scanning and printing section where I documented my processes of each.</p>
            <h1>January 16 2025</h1>
            <p>I spent most of today just updating and fixing my website as I had to submit a couple of assignments. I fixed some grammar, added pictures, and added this section for my groups continued testing and prototyping.</p>
