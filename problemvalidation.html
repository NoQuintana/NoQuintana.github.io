            <p>One of the professionals I was able to come in to contact with was Dr. Rossanna Buigas M.D. who runs a private business dealing with a wide variety of medical issues including joint pains. The doctor oversees many patients that suffer from injuries and ailments pertaning to the wrists such as arthritis. This would be the main reason I wished to contact this specific professional as they have vast experience with the wrist and its associated joints which should offer a very helpful push to the design of our groups project. When I had asked what the main cause of wrist pain/discomfort was the doctor had stated it was mostly caused by the pressure that is applied on said wrist joint(s). When asked the best way to prevent such pains the doctor had said it would be best to somehow monitor the amount of pressure placed on the wrist and its joints. With this insight our group will most likely wish to pursue some sort of device that would allow the user to track the amount of pressure they place their wrist under to circumvent any wrist problems. The other staff of the building seemed to share a consensus with the doctor and even offered additional advice saying that the overuse of the joints in the wrist would cause them discomfort or pain. With this additional information we could also attempt to implement a timer on our device that displays how long you have been writing for and would suggest breaks for the user so they dont overuse their respective joints.</p>
            <p>Another professional I attempted to contact was Dr. Adrian Vazquez who I attempted to contact through our school's website BConnected. One of the main reasons I wished to seek their expertise is the fact that they specialize with rheumatology which is a profession that mainly deals with joint pain. Through this I had hoped to gain extra information on external factrs that can lead to wrist discomfort or pain other than pressure on the joints. As of recent I have gotten no response back from the proffesionals I had contacted and if at some point I do receive a reply I will update this section. However, through my reasearch so far the leading cause of wrist injuries is the overuse of the joints as well as the amount of pressure places on them. </p>
